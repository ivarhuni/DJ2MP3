# Project Download Directory Instructions

- All downloads from `DJ2MP3_spotify_via_soulseek.py` and `DJ2MP3_youtube_via_soulseek.py` should be saved in the `/soulseek_downloads` directory.

- The YouTube script (`DJ2MP3_youtube_via_soulseek.py`) should save its downloads under a `youtube` subfolder inside `/soulseek_downloads`.

**Example directory structure:**

```
/soulseek_downloads/
    youtube/
        <YouTube video title>/
            ...downloaded files...
    <Spotify playlist name>/
        ...downloaded files...
```

- This ensures all Soulseek downloads are organized in a single location, with YouTube and Spotify sources clearly separated.
